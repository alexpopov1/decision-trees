# decision-trees
An easy-to-use library to generate classification and regression trees (CART) for datasets. The software provides flexibility when designing the predictor, with options to set and tune various hyperparameters, as well as to apply bagging (to reduce variance) and random feature selection (to prevent correlation between different sampled trees in bagging).
